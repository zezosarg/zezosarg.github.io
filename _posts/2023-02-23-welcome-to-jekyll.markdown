In order to build my new personal web page, i decided to use `Jekyll`, which is a popular static site generator.

It powers `GitHub Pages` and integrates well within deployment on `GitHub`.

Moreover i recently gained experience on the `Ruby on Rails` framework which will make modifying and maintaining the site a breeze.

Here is a demo of its snippet highlighting

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end
print_hello('Web')
#=> prints 'Hi, Web' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
